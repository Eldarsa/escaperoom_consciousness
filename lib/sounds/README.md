Note that the sounds have to be uploaded directly to the soundboard, just like you would with a USB. 
They are kept here so that they are stored in the same GIT repo. 

Only the WAV format (or .OGG) can be used on the board. Convert from MP3 if necessary. 

Sound board instructions can be found here: https://docs.rs-online.com/5207/0900766b81533fac.pdf

Each file has to be named T<number><trigger_type>. For instance "T01HOLDL", "T02" or "T03LATCH". The naming dictates the behavior! Read the manual above to find out more.
